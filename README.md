# Constrained-Stochastic-Optimization-Inequality

This respository implements the method in the paper [Inequality Constrained Stochastic Nonlinear Optimization via Active-Set Sequential Quadratic Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.11502). We implement stochastic active-set SQP  schemes, that use the augmented Lagrangian merit function, on 39 probblems with inequality constraints in CUTEst test set. 

The setup of CUTEst is available at https://github.com/JuliaSmoothOptimizers/CUTEst.jl.
